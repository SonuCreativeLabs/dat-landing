    content: `Is your refrigerator not cooling properly? A non-functional fridge can spoil food, waste money, and cause inconvenience. Here are some common reasons why your fridge isn't cooling and how you can fix it:

1. Dirty or Blocked Condenser Coils
• Problem: Dust buildup on the condenser coils can reduce cooling efficiency.
• Fix: Clean the coils using a vacuum or a dry cloth to improve cooling performance.

2. Overloaded Fridge
• Problem: Storing too many items blocks airflow, preventing cold air from circulating.
• Fix: Remove excess food and ensure air can flow freely inside.

3. Faulty Thermostat
• Problem: If the thermostat is set too low or is faulty, the fridge may not cool properly.
• Fix: Adjust the thermostat settings and test if cooling improves. If not, the thermostat may need replacement.

4. Broken Door Seal (Gasket Issue)
• Problem: A loose or damaged door seal allows cold air to escape, making the fridge warm.
• Fix: Inspect the seal and replace it if necessary. You can test by placing a paper between the door—if it slips out easily, the seal needs to be changed.

5. Low Refrigerant (Gas Leak)
• Problem: If your fridge is not cooling at all, it could be due to low refrigerant levels.
• Fix: A professional technician must refill the gas and check for leaks.`,

    content: `A washing machine breakdown can be frustrating, especially when you have a pile of laundry waiting. If your washing machine isn't working properly, don't worry! Here are some common washing machine problems and how you can fix them.

1. Washing Machine Won't Start
• Problem: If your machine doesn't turn on, it could be due to a faulty power connection, damaged power cord, or a broken control board.
• Fix:
• Check if the power supply is properly connected.
• Test the socket with another device to see if it's working.
• If the power cord is fine, you may need a technician to inspect the control board.

2. Water Not Draining Properly
• Problem: If the water remains in the drum after a wash cycle, there may be a clogged drain hose or a faulty drain pump.
• Fix:
• Check if the drain hose is blocked with lint, small objects, or dirt.
• Clean the drain filter regularly to prevent clogging.
• If the issue persists, you may need a drain pump repair or replacement.

3. Washing Machine Making Loud Noise or Vibrating
• Problem: If your washing machine is too noisy or shaking excessively, the drum might be unbalanced, or there could be a loose part inside.
• Fix:
• Make sure your washing machine is placed on a level surface.
• Do not overload the machine with too many clothes.
• If the noise continues, a technician can inspect the drum and bearings.

4. Clothes Are Not Cleaning Properly
• Problem: If your clothes come out dirty after washing, it could be due to low detergent, hard water deposits, or a dirty drum.
• Fix:
• Use the right amount of detergent based on the load size.
• Clean the drum by running an empty cycle with hot water and vinegar.
• If your area has hard water, consider installing a water softener for better cleaning.

5. Water Leaking from the Machine
• Problem: Water leakage can be due to a loose hose, worn-out door seal, or a damaged pump.
• Fix:
• Check if the hose connections are tight and not leaking.
• Inspect the rubber door gasket for cracks or dirt buildup.
• If the leakage continues, a technician can replace the damaged parts.`,
